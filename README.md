Open Source Novel: Choose Your Own Adventure

Welcome to Choose, an open source novel created by engineers, designers and really, really imaginitiave people.  This novel will allow you to create a new page to link to.  

Here are the rules: 

1) Each new segment should be about 500 words. If you'd like to make one sentence, go for it. If you'd like to write two pages, go for it.  But 500 words is a good thing to aim for at the begininning. 
2) You may link to an alternative ending that's all ready been written.
3) List each new page on the 'index' with a hyperlink attachment. 
4) Please be sensitive to all readers. Degrading others and plotting harm is not tolerated. 
5) Using people's names and stories without their permission is illegal. Don't do it. 
6) Have fun. Make someone smile.  
7) Please try to name your commits so that it's easy to find new stories versus edits to stories. When possible use these prefixes to your commit names:
- New (when you add a new narrative)
- Edit (when you change a narrative that's all ready been created)
- Link (when you change/add a link as an option to a new segment)
